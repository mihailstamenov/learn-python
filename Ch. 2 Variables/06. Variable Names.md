# Variable Names

Variable names can _not_ have spaces, they're continuous strings of characters.

The creator of the Python language himself, [Guido van Rossum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum), [implores us](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#function-and-variable-names) to use `snake_case` for variable names. What _is_ snake case? It's just a style for writing variable names. Here are some examples of different casing styles:

|Name|Description|Code|Language(s) that recommend it|
|---|---|---|---|
|Snake Case|All words are lowercase and separated by underscores|`my_hero_health`|Python, Ruby, Rust|
|Camel Case|Capitalize the first letter of each word _except the first one_|`myHeroHealth`|JavaScript, Java|
|Pascal Case|Capitalize the first letter of each word|`MyHeroHealth`|C#, C++|
|No Casing|All lowercase with no separation|`myherohealth`|No one: don't do this|

To be clear, your Python code will still _work_ with Camel Case or Pascal Case, but can we please just have nice things? We just want some consistency in our craft.

If you won't use snake case for _you_, do it for _me_. I beg you.
