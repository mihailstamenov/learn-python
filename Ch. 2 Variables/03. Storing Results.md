# Storing Results

Now that we know how to store and change the value of variables let's do some math!

Here are some examples of common mathematical operators in Python syntax.

```py
summation = a + b  # Addition
difference = a - b # Subtraction
product = a * b    # Multiplication
quotient = a / b   # Division
```

Parentheses can be used to [order math operations](https://www.mathsisfun.com/operation-order-pemdas.html).

```py
avg = (a + b + c) / 3
```
