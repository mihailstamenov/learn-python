# NoneType Quiz

As we mentioned in the last exercise, the `None` keyword is used to define an "empty" variable.

So when would you _use_ it? One usecase is to represent that a value hasn't been determined yet, for example, an uncaptured input. For example, maybe your program is waiting for a user to enter their name. You might start with a variable:

```py
username = None
```

Then later in the code, once the user has entered their name, you can assign it to the `username` variable:

```py
username = input("What's your name? ")
```

Remember, it's crucial to recognize that `None` is not the same as the string `"None"`. They look the same when printed to the console, but they are different data types. If you use `"None"` instead of `None`, you will end up with code that looks correct when it's _printed_ but fails the _tests_.
