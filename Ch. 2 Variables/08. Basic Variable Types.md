# Basic Variable Types

Python has several basic [data types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type).

## Strings

In programming snippets of text are called "[strings](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#textseq)". They're lists of characters _strung_ together. We create strings by wrapping the text in single quotes or double quotes. That said, **double quotes are preferred**.

```py
name_with_single_quotes = 'boot.dev' # not so good
name_with_double_quotes = "boot.dev" # so good
```
## Numbers

Numbers are _not_ surrounded by quotes when they're declared.

**An [integer](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/long.html) is a number without a decimal part**:

```py
x = 5 # positive integer
y = -5 # negative integer
```

**A [float](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#float) is a number with a decimal part**:

```py
x = 5.2
y = -5.2
```
## Booleans

A ["Boolean"](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/bool.html#boolean-objects) (or "bool") is a type that can only have one of two values: `True` or `False`. As you may have heard, computers really only use 1's and 0's. These 1's and 0's are just `True/False` boolean values.

```py
is_tall = True
is_short = False
```

## Assignment

Fix the bugs in the code. `player_health` should be an integer and `player_has_magic` should be a boolean.
