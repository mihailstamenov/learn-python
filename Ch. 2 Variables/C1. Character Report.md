# Character Report

One of our interns started working on a program that outputs data about Fantasy Quest player characters. It's nearly done but has various bugs.

## Assignment

Fix the bugs and get the character report working!

1. Update the variables to their expected data types:

- `name`: `string`
- `level`: `integer`
- `character_class`: `string`
- `armor`: `integer`
- `magic_resistance`: `float`
- `account_active`: `boolean`

2. Fix the bug with the f-string on line 9.

## Original Values

```py
name = "Lopen"
level = "25"
character_class = Windrunner
armor = 12.0
magic_resistance = 15.4
account_active = "True"
```
