# Variables

[Variables](https://www.cs.utah.edu/~germain/PPS/Topics/variables.html) are how we _store_ data as our program runs. Up 'till now we've been _printing_ data by passing it straight into [`print()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#print). Now we're going to _save_ the data in variables so we can reuse it and change it _before_ printing it.

## Creating Variables

A "variable" is just a name that we give to a value. For example, we can make a new variable named `my_height` and set its value to `100`:

```py
my_height = 100
```

Or we can define a variable called `my_name` and set it to the text string `"Lane"`:

```py
my_name = "Lane"
```

We have the freedom to choose any name for our variables, but they should be _descriptive_ and consist of a single ["token"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_analysis#Token), meaning continuous text with underscores separating the words.

## Using Variables

Once we have a variable, we can access its value by using its name. For example, this will print `100`:

```py
print(my_height)
```

And this will print `Lane`:

```py
print(my_name)
```

## Assignment

We need to keep track of our hero's health!

On the first line of code, create a new variable named `player_health` and set it equal to `1000`.
