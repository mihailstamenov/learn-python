# Dynamic Typing

Python is [dynamically typed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system#Static_and_dynamic_type_checking_in_practice), which means a variable can store any type, and that type can _change_.

For example, if I make a number variable, I can later change that variable to a string:

```py
speed = 5
speed = "five"
```

## But Like, Maybe Don't

In almost all circumstances, it's a _bad idea_ to change the type of a variable. The "proper" thing to do is to just create a new one. For example:

```py
speed = 5
speed_description = "five"
```

## What Is Non-Dynamic Typing?

Languages that aren't dynamically typed are [statically typed](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Static_typing), such as Go (which you'll learn in a later course). In a statically typed language, if you try to assign a value to a variable of the wrong type, an error would crash the program.

If Python were statically typed, the first example from before would crash on the second line, `speed = "five"`. The computer would give an error along the lines of `you can't assign a string value ("five") to a number variable (speed)`.
