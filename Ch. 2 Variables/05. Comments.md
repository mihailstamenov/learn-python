# Comments

Comments don't do... anything. They are _ignored_ by the Python interpreter. That said, they're good for what the name implies: adding comments to your code in plain English (or whatever language you speak).

## Single Line Comment

A single `#` makes the rest of the line a comment:

```py
# speed describes how fast the player
# moves in meters per second
speed = 2
```

## Multi-Line Comments (Aka [docstrings](https://peps.python.org/pep-0257/))

You can use triple quotes to start and end multi-line comments as well:

```python
"""
    the code found below
    will print 'Hello, World!' to the console
"""
print("Hello, World!")
```

This is useful if you don't want to add the `#` to the start of each line when writing paragraphs of comments.

## Assignment

Line #1 in the code was meant to be a comment, but the developer forgot to use the correct syntax (`#`).

**Fix the bug by commenting out the first line of code**.
