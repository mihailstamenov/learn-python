# Archmage

Congratulations on making it to the end of the functions chapter!

This is one of the hardest chapters in the Python course - though dictionaries are no walk in the park either.

You've probably already figured out that:

- Chests contain gems and items
- Gems can buy items in the [shop](https://www.boot.dev/lessons/4777c0b2-30fa-48fe-82bf-c9b84e74d92f#)
- Items help you earn [achievements](https://www.boot.dev/lessons/4777c0b2-30fa-48fe-82bf-c9b84e74d92f#) and XP
- XP levels you up, and higher levels unlock new roles

**So why should you care about your role?**

My _guess_ is that you've earned enough XP to be an `Apprentice` by now. You can see your role at the top right of your screen. When you hit level `100`, you'll **unlock the `Archmage` role**. _It's kind of a big deal_. When you hit archmage:

1. You'll have learned a _ton_, built many real-world projects, and should be starting your job search
2. You'll have unlocked all the private role-based chat channels in our [Discord](https://www.boot.dev/community)
3. You'll have immeasurable bragging rights and a hoard of fake internet points
4. **You'll get a physical archmage coin in the mail as a token of your hard work**
