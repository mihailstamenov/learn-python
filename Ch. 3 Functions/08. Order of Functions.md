# Order of Functions

All functions _must_ be defined before they're used.

You might think this would make structuring Python code hard because the order of the functions needs to be _just right_. As it turns out, there's a simple trick that makes it super easy.

Most Python developers solve this problem by defining _all_ the functions in their program first, then they call an "entry point" function _last_. That way _all_ of the functions have been read by the Python interpreter before the first one is called.

Note: _conventionally this "entry point" function is usually called `main` to keep things simple and consistent_.

```python
def main():
    health = 10
    armor = 5
    add_armor(health, armor)

def add_armor(h, a):
    new_health = h + a
    print_health(new_health)

def print_health(new_health):
    print(f"The player now has {new_health} health")

# call entrypoint last
main()
```
