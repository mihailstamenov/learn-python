# Solutions

Okay, I just need to tell you about _one last_ recourse you have when you're stuck. Every lesson on Boot.dev has an [instructor solution](https://www.boot.dev/lessons/6b3ce0b8-b323-4685-bf50-48cfd1c9959d#) that you can view!

Like Boots, solutions come at a cost... a steeper one in fact. If you view a solution _before_ you complete the lesson, you'll lose _all_ the XP for that lesson. Well, unless you use a seer stone - in which case you won't lose any XP. Though you will be down a seer stone.

Just like it's free to use Boots after a lesson is complete, viewing a solution after you've completed the lesson is free as well. In fact, we encourage you to frequently check your work against ours, often times there's something to learn from the differences.

_View solutions sparingly_. If you find yourself using the solution _before completion_ more than about once per chapter you should consider slowing down, asking for help in the discord, and even resetting lessons and trying them again to build a stronger foundation.

## Assignment

_Enough about solution mechanics, let's write more code_.

We need to display the current time to our players. The problem is that the time is stored as a number of _hours_, but we want to display it as a number of _seconds_. There are 60 seconds in a minute, but how many are in an hour?

**Complete the `hours_to_seconds` function**. It should convert `hours` to `seconds` and return the result.
