# Enchant and Attack

In Fantasy Quest, a weapon can be enchanted to do bonus damage.

## Assignment

Complete the `enchant_and_attack` function. It creates a new "enchanted" name for a weapon and calculates how much damage the enchanted weapon will deal to a targeted enemy.

It accepts 3 parameters:

- `target_health`: integer
- `damage`: integer
- `weapon`: string

It should do the following things in the function body:

1. Calculate and store the "enchanted damage" in a new variable. The enchanted damage should be the input `damage` plus `10`.
2. Calculate and store the "new health" in a new variable. The new health should be the input `target_health` minus the enchanted damage.
3. Create a new variable called `enchanted_weapon`. It should be the input `weapon` with the string "enchanted " added to the beginning of it. For example:
    1. `sword` -> `enchanted sword`
    2. `axe` -> `enchanted axe`
4. Return the enchanted weapon and the new health in that order.
