# Where to Declare Functions

You've probably noticed that a variable needs to be declared _before_ it's used. For example, the following doesn't work:

```py
print(my_name)
my_name = 'Lane Wagner'
```

It needs to be:

```py
my_name = 'Lane Wagner'
print(my_name)
```

Code executes in _order from top to bottom_, so a variable needs to be created before it can be used. That means that if you define a function, you can't call that function until _after_ the definition.

There's a bug! Run the code and read the printed error, then fix it.
