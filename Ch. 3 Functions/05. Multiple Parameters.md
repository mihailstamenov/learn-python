# Multiple Parameters

Functions can have multiple parameters ("parameter" being a fancy word for "input"). For example, this `subtract` function accepts 2 parameters: `a` and `b`.

```py
def subtract(a, b):
    result = a - b
    return result
```

The name of a parameter doesn't matter when it comes to which values will be assigned to which parameter. It's **position** that matters. The first parameter will become the first value that's passed in, the second parameter is the second value that's passed in, and so on. In this example, the `subtract` function is called with `a = 5` and `b = 3`:

```py
result = subtract(5, 3)
print(result)
# 2
```

Here's an example with four parameters:

```py
def create_introduction(name, age, height, weight):
    first_part = "Your name is " + name + " and you are " + age + " years old."
    second_part = "You are " + height + " meters tall and weigh " + weight + " kilograms."
    full_intro = first_part + " " + second_part
    return full_intro
```

It can be called like this:

```py
my_name = "John"
my_age = "30"

intro = create_introduction(my_name, my_age, "1.8", "80")
print(intro)
# Your name is John and you are 30 years old. You are 1.8 meters tall and weigh 80 kilograms.
```

## Assignment

We need to calculate the `total` damage from a combo of three damaging attacks. Complete the `triple_attack` function that takes three numbers as its parameters, `damage_one`, `damage_two`, and `damage_three`, and returns the sum.

The attacks (`attack_one` to `attack_six`) are already passed to two `triple_attack` functions for you, so you do not need to use them directly in the function.
