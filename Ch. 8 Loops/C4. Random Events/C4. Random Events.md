# Random Events

The Fantasy Quest team has been working on a new feature: random events! These new events are ready to go but they need a way to trigger in the open world for players to experience them.

## Assignment

The team wants the random events to trigger on prime numbers. Write a function that takes a single number as input and returns `True` if it is a prime number or `False` if it is not.

### What Is a Prime Number?

A [prime number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number) is a _positive_ integer, greater than 1, that is only divisible by itself and 1. For example, 2, 3, 5, and 7 are all prime numbers, but 1, 4, 6, 8, and 9 are not. `0` and `1` are _not_ prime numbers! And don't forget to catch all negative numbers!

### Modulo

We'll talk more about it next chapter, but you can use the modulo operator `%` to find a remainder. For example, `7` [modulo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulo_operation) `2` would be `1`, because 2 can be multiplied evenly into 7 at most 3 times.

```py
remainder = 8 % 3
# remainder = 2

remainder = 9 % 3
# remainder = 0
```

If you get stuck, feel free to move ahead and come back after learning more about the modulo operator.
