# Experience Points

You've been hired by a game studio to work on their latest role-playing game. In this game adventurers need experience points (XP) to level up and become stronger. You've been tasked with updating a part of the player statistics panel. We want to show the total xp a player has gained based on their current level.

Each character starts with 0 XP at level `1`. To reach the next level, they need XP equal to their current level times 5.

|Level|XP To Next Level|Total XP Gained|
|---|---|---|
|1|5|0|
|2|10|5|
|3|15|15|
|4|20|30|

## Assignment

Complete the `calculate_experience_points` function.

The `calculate_experience_points` function takes a single parameter named `level`. Determine the total XP they have gained to reach the specified `level` from level `1` and return it.
