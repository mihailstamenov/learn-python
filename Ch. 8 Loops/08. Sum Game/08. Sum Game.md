# Sum Game

Remember you can use in-place operators to increase or decrease a variable by any amount.

```py
number_of_enemies = 10
number_of_enemies += 2
# number_of_enemies is 12
```

```py
number_of_enemies = 10
number_of_enemies -= 2
# number_of_enemies is 8
```

## Assignment

Fix the bug in the `sum_of_numbers` function. Instead of adding 1 to `total` at each iteration of the loop, it should add `i`. For example, instead of:

`1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1...`

we want:

`0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4...`

The desired output is a single number after the loop has finished executing.
