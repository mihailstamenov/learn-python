# Range Continued

The `range()` function we've been using in our `for` loops actually has an optional 3rd parameter: the "step".

```py
for i in range(0, 10, 2):
    print(i)
# prints:
# 0
# 2
# 4
# 6
# 8
```

The "step" parameter determines how much to add to `i` in each iteration of the loop. You can even go backwards:

```py
for i in range(3, 0, -1):
    print(i)
# prints:
# 3
# 2
# 1
```

## Assignment

Fix the `for` loop in the `count_down` function so that it prints the numbers counting down from `start` to (but not including) `end` in order.

## Tip

In the programming world, it's common for the first number in a range to be _inclusive_ and the second number is _exclusive_. e.g. `range(0, 10)` will include:

```
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```
