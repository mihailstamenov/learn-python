# Floor Division

Python has great out-of-the-box support for mathematical operations. This, among other reasons, is why it has had such success in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science applications.

Floor division is like normal division except the result is [floored](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floor_and_ceiling_functions) afterward, which means the result is rounded down to the nearest integer. The `//` operator is used for floor division.

```python
7 // 3
# 2 (an integer, rounded down from 2.333)
-7 // 3
# -3 (an integer, rounded down from -2.333)
```
