# Changing in Place

It's fairly common to want to change the value of a variable based on its current value.

```py
player_score = 4
player_score = player_score + 1
# player_score now equals 5
```

```py
player_score = 4
player_score = player_score - 1
# player_score now equals 3
```

Don't let the fact that the expression `player_score = player_score - 1` is not a valid mathematical expression be confusing. _It doesn't matter_, it _is valid code_. It's valid because the way the expression should be read in English is:

> Assign to `player_score` the current value of `player_score` minus 1

In this operation, the right-hand side (`player_score - 1`) is calculated first. Once we have the result, we update `player_score` with this new value.

## Assignment

Complete the `update_player_score` function. It should add `increment` to `current_score` and then return the new `current_score`.
