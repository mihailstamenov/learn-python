# Numbers Review

## Integers

In Python, numbers without a decimal point are called `Integers`.

Integers are simply whole numbers, positive or negative. For example, `3` and `-3` are both examples of integers.

## Floats

A float is, as you may have guessed, the number type that allows for decimal values.

```py
my_int = 5
my_float = 5.5
```
