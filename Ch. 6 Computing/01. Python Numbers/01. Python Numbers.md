# Python Numbers

In Python, numbers without a decimal point are called `Integers` - just like they are in mathematics.

Integers are simply whole numbers, positive or negative. For example, `3` and `-3` are both examples of integers.

Arithmetic can be performed as you might expect:

## Addition

```python
2 + 1
# 3
```

## Subtraction

```python
2 - 1
# 1
```

## Multiplication

```python
2 * 2
# 4
```

## Division

```python
3 / 2
# 1.5 (a float)
```


This one is actually a bit different - division on two integers will actually produce a [float](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html). A `float` is, as you may have guessed, the number type that allows for decimal values.

## Assignment

Complete the missing sections of the `calculate_damage` function.

- Fix the `total_damage` variable so that it contains the sum of all the different weapons' and spells' damage values.
- Fix the `average_damage` variable so that it contains the _[average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Average)_ of the combined weapon and spell damage.
