# Why Python?
Here are some reasons we think Python is a future-proof choice for developers:

- Easy to read and write - Python reads like plain English. Due to its simple syntax, it's a great choice for implementing advanced concepts like AI. - This is arguably Python's best feature.
- Popular - According to the Stack Overflow Developer Survey, [Python is the 3rd most popular](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/technology#1-programming-scripting-and-markup-languages) coding language in 2024.
- Free - Python, like many languages nowadays, is developed under an open-source license. It's free to install, use, and distribute.
- Portable - Python written for one platform will work on any other platform.
- Interpreted - Code can be executed as soon as it's written. Because it doesn't need to take a long time to compile like Java, C++, or Rust, releasing code to production is typically faster.

## Why not Python?
Python might not be the best choice for a project if:

- The code needs to run fast. Python code executes very slowly, which is why performance critical applications like PC games aren't written in Python.
- The codebase will become large and complex. Due to its dynamic type system, Python code can be harder to keep clean of bugs.
- The application needs to be distributed directly to non-technical users. They would have to install Python in order to run your code, which would be a huge inconvenience.
