# Python 2 vs Python 3
One thing that's important to keep in mind as you continue your Python journey is that the Python ecosystem is fragmented. Python 3 was released on December 3rd, 2008, but over a decade later the web is still full of Python 2 dependencies, scripts and tutorials.

In this course, we used Python 3 - just like any good citizen should these days.

One of the most obvious breaking changes between Python 2 and 3 is the syntax for printing text to the console.

## Python 2
```python
print "hello world"
```

## Python 3
```python
print("hello world")
```
