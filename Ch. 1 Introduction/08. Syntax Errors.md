# Syntax Errors

["Syntax"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntax_(programming_languages)) is jargon for "valid code that the computer can understand". For example, the following code has _invalid_ syntax:

```py
print("hello world')
```

It has mismatched quotes around the string `hello world`. One is a single quote `'` and the other is a double quote `"`.
