# Multiple Instructions

Code runs in order, starting at the top of the program. For example:

```py
print("this prints first")
print("this prints second")
print("this prints last")
```

Each `print()` instruction prints on a new line.

## Assignment

The dialogue in our game should display in the correct order! In the first level, our hero encounters a talking owl named Jax.

1. _Run_ (not submit) the code and see that it's printed in the wrong order
2. Rearrange the code so that it prints in the following (correct) order:

```
Jax: B-Kaw!
Hero: ...
Jax: Where are you off to this morning? Bkaw...
Hero: Where did an owl learn to speak??
```
