# The Console

The "console" is a panel that displays important messages, like errors or the text output of a program. If we want to see what's happening in our code, we need to print it to the console by using the `print()` function.

We'll learn more about functions later, but for now, just know that the `print()` function will print anything you put inside its parentheses. For example:

```python
print("this is some example text to print")
```
