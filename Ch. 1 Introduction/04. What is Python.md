# What Is Python?

Hundreds of thousands of students start their coding journey right here with [Python](https://www.python.org/).

Python doesn't _have_ to be your first language, but _I_ think it's the best first language for most developers. It gets out of your way so you can focus on learning fundamental programming concepts.

But just because Python is simple doesn't mean it's not useful! Python is an [_extremely_ popular](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2024/technology) language in the industry, and is well-known for:

- Backend web servers
- DevOps and cloud engineering
- Machine learning
- Scripting and automation
- etc...

On the other hand, it's not particularly well-known for front-end development. While it's _possible_ to do so, Python isn't typically used to build user interfaces.
