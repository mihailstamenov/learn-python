# Shop Response

Our dev team has been making updates to Fantasy Quest's innkeeper shop. But there's a problem! The Innkeeper's text dialogue is empty!

## Assignment

Add 2 separate `print` statements to complete the Innkeeper's response. They should say the following:

`Ah! Great choices...`

`Is there anything else I can help you with?`
