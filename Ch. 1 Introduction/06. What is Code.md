# What Is "Code"?

Code is just a series of instructions for a computer to follow one after another. Programs can have _a lot_ of instructions.

The Boot.dev backend has 46,119 lines of code as I write this... and it's much smaller than some other projects I've worked on.

Remember how we used the `print()` instruction to print text to the console? We can also use it to print numbers. This prints the number `42`:

```py
print(42)
```

Well, [addition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addition) is one of the most common instructions in programming. This _also_ prints the number `42`:

```py
print(40 + 2)
```

It first calculates the sum inside the parentheses, and _then_ prints the result.

## Assignment

Simple addition is used _all the time_ in game development. In Fantasy Quest, we want weapons to deal bonus damage when they're enchanted.

Our hero's sword deals `250` damage normally, but should deal an _additional_ `75` damage when it's enchanted.

**Calculate and print the result of `250 + 75`**
