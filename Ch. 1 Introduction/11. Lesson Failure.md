# Lesson Failure

You've probably noticed that you have a `Submit` _and_ a `Run` button.

- **Run**: For testing and debugging. There is no penalty for running your code.
- **Submit**: Runs your code, but also checks its output against our answer key. If the output doesn't match, you'll be _punished_.

Pro tip: You wouldn't deploy code to end users without testing... right? So don't submit code without running it first! The goal of this game mechanic is to encourage good real-world coding practices. "Submit" is like deploying to production.

## What's the Penalty?

When you fail a lesson, one of two things will happen:

- **If you have [armor](https://www.boot.dev/lessons/142c8a73-5ede-49a6-9460-563890646023#)**, you'll lose one. That armor is consumed to protect you from future failures _on that lesson_.
- **If you don't have an armor**, you'll lose your [sharpshooter spree](https://www.boot.dev/lessons/142c8a73-5ede-49a6-9460-563890646023#), and it will reset to zero. Each time your spree counter hits 15, you'll earn a random chest. Chests contain gems and items (like armor).

## Assignment

Fantasy Quest has a bug in its server code. The code is supposed to print messages indicating the game server has started successfully.

**Fix both syntax errors in the code**.
