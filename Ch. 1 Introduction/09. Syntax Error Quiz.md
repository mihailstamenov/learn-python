# Syntax Errors Quiz

**Syntax**: The rules for how [expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_(computer_science)) and [statements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statement_(computer_science)) should be structured in a language. For example, in Python, the following is _correct_ syntax:

```py
print("hello world")
```

While in a different programming language, like Go, the correct syntax would be:

```go
fmt.Println("hello world")
```

Syntax errors aren't the _only_ kind of problems you can run into when coding, for example:

- **A bug in your logic**. Your code is _valid_, and will _run_, but it does something unexpected.
- **It's too slow**. Your code is _valid_ and does _what's expected_, but it does it slowly

_In this course, we're just concerned with syntax and logic errors. We'll cover performance issues in a later course_.
