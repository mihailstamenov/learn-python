# Scope

Scope refers to _where_ a variable or function name is available to be used. For example, when we create variables in a function (such as by giving names to our parameters), that data is _not_ available outside of that function.

## Example

```py
def subtract(x, y):
    return x - y
result = subtract(5, 3)
print(x)
# ERROR! "name 'x' is not defined"
```

When the `subtract` function is called, we assign 5 to the variable `x`, but `x` only exists in the code _within_ the `subtract` function. If we try to print `x` outside of that function, then we won't get a result. In fact, we'll get a big fat error.

## Assignment

Find the bug in the code on line `10`. We're using variable names from the wrong scope. Fix it!

_Note: This video mentions "for-loops" and "lists" to prepare for them later._
