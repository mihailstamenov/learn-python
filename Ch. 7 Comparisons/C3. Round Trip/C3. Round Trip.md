# Round Trip

Rogue characters in Fantasy Quest expend energy when they sprint. Tyler is trying to figure out if his rogue has enough energy to get him from the inn to the capital city _**and back to the inn**_. He needs to go to the capital to pay his yearly income tax, but wants to return to the inn because it has a complimentary continental breakfast.

## Assignment

Complete the `has_enough_energy` function to check if Tyler can make a round trip.

Do some Pythonic math with the `distance_one_way` and `meters_per_energy` variables to determine how many points of energy are needed for Tyler to get to the capital city _AND_ make it back to the inn. Assign the result to a `energy_needed` variable. `distance_one_way` is how many meters it is to get from here to there. `meters_per_energy` is how far Tyler's rogue can travel with one energy point.

Return `True` if there is at least enough energy for a round trip both there and back based on the `energy_needed` variable, and `False` otherwise.

## Hint

- If you travel `distance_one_way` from point A to point B, you will have to travel that same distance _**again**_ to get back to point A.
