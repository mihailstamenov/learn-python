# Combat Advantage

Fantasy Quest doesn't have any way for players to know if they are strong enough to fight certain enemies.

- If a player's power level is greater than the enemy's defense, that player has an _advantage_
- If the player's power and enemy's defense are equal, they are _evenly matched_
- Otherwise, that player has a _disadvantage_.

## Assignment

On line `4` write an if/elif/else block. Using the rules specified above, set `advantage`, `disadvantage`, or `evenly_matched` to `True` depending on the values of `player_power` and `enemy_defense`.

For example, if the player's power is greater than the enemy's defense, `advantage` should be set to `True`. etc.
