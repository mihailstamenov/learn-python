# If-Else Practice

Here are some basic rules with if/else blocks.

- You can't have an `elif` or an `else` without an `if`
- You _can_ have an `else` without an `elif`

Remember, to check if two values are the same use the `==` operator.

```py
same = 5 == 6
# same is False

same = 6 == 6
# same is True
```

## Assignment

There is a bug in the `check_high_score` function! Add the proper conditional statement to fix the bug. If the names match, return the string:

```
You are the highest scoring player!
```

Otherwise, return:

```
You are not the highest scoring player!
```
