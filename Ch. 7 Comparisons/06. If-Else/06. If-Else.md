# If-Else

An `if` statement can be followed by zero or more `elif` (which stands for "else if") statements, which can be followed by zero or one `else` statements.

For example:

```py
if score > high_score:
    print("High score beat!")
elif score > second_highest_score:
    print("You got second place!")
elif score > third_highest_score:
    print("You got third place!")
else:
    print("Better luck next time")
```

First the `if` statement is evaluated. If it is `True` then the if statement's body is executed and all the other `else`s are ignored.

If the first `if` is false then the next `elif` is evaluated. Likewise, if it is `True` then its body is executed and the rest are ignored.

If none of the `if` statements evaluate to `True` then the final `else` statement will be the only body executed.

## Assignment

Complete the `player_status` function. If the player's `health` is less than or equal to `0`, `return` the string:

```
dead
```


Otherwise, if it's less than or equal to `5` `return` the string:

```

```


Otherwise, `return` the string:

```

```
