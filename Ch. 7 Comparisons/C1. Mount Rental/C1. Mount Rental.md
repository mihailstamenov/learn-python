# Mount Rental

We are adding a new feature to Fantasy Quest that allows characters to rent other players' flying mounts from the "Uper" ride sharing guild. The character must return the mount before they have used up all their time otherwise they are charged an overtime fee of additional gold by Uper guild investors.

## Assignment

Write the `check_mount_rental` function. It takes two inputs:

1. `time_used` - the amount of time the mount has been used in minutes
2. `time_purchased` - the amount of time the character rented the mount for

- If `time_used` _meets or exceeds_ `time_purchased`, then the rental is expired and greedy Uper will charge a fee, so the function should return the string `"overtime charged"`
- Otherwise, return the string `"no charges yet"`

Bonus: Try to accomplish this without an "else" statement.
