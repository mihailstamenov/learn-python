# If Practice

Remember, you can use the `==` operator to check if two values are equal. For example:

```py
is_equal = 5 == 5
# is_equal is True
```

## Assignment

Complete the `check_swords_for_army` function. If the number of swords and the number of soldiers match, return the string:

```
correct amount
```

Otherwise, return the string:

```
incorrect amount
```

Punctuation matters! Make sure you return the strings exactly as they appear above.

## Tip

You only need to use one `if` statement and two `return` statements to complete the function.
