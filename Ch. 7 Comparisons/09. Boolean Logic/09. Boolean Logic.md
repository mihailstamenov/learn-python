# Boolean Logic

Boolean logic refers to logic dealing with boolean (`True` or `False`) values. For example,

Dogs must have four legs _and_ weigh less than 100 kilograms. (Both conditions must be true)

Cars are cool if they go faster than 200 MPH, _or_ if they are electric. (At least one condition must be true)

## Logical Operators Review

As we discussed earlier, the logical operators `and` and `or` can be used to perform boolean logic.

### And Review

The `and` operator returns `True` if _both_ of the conditions on either side evaluates to `True`:

```py
def is_dog(num_legs, weight):
    return num_legs == 4 and weight < 100
```

Let's go over how this function evaluates the parameters `num_legs=4` and `weight=99`:

```py
return 4 == 4 and 99 < 100
```


```py
return True and True
```

```py
return True
```

Let's see what would happen with `3` and `98` instead:

```py
return 3 == 4 and 98 < 100
```

```py
return False and True
```

```py
return False
```

### Or Review

The `or` operator returns `True` if _at least one_ of the conditions on either side evaluates to `True`:

```py
def is_car_cool(speed, is_electric):
    return speed > 200 or is_electric
```

Let's use a non-electric car that can do 250:

```py
return 250 > 200 or False
```

```py
return True or False
```

```py
return True
```

## Assignment

We need a way for our game to track whether a character's attack hits or misses.

Complete the `does_attack_hit` function. The function should return `True` if _either_ of the following conditions are met:

- The `attack_roll` is _not_ a `1` _and_ the attack roll is greater than or equal to the `armor_class`, or
- The attack roll is a `20`

Otherwise, it should return `False`.

## Tip

Remember that you can define the order of operations using parentheses:

```py
# The college admits students with a high GPA and high SAT score
# or anyone who is just rich
should_admit = (high_gpa and high_sat_score) or (is_rich)
```
