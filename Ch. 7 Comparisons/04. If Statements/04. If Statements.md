# If Statements

It's often useful to only execute code if a certain condition is met:

```py
if CONDITION:
	# do some stuff here

# code after the if block may still run regardless
```

For example, in this code:

```py
def show_status(boss_health):
    if boss_health > 0:
        print("Ganondorf is alive!")
        return
    print("Ganondorf is unalive!")
```

if `boss_health` is greater than `0`, then this will be printed:

```plaintext
Ganondorf is alive!
```

Otherwise, this will be printed:

```plaintext
Ganondorf is unalive!
```

Without a `return` in the `if` block, `Ganondor is unalive` would always be printed:

```py
def show_status(boss_health):
    if boss_health > 0:
        print("Ganondorf is alive!")
    print("Ganondorf is unalive!")
```

This code could print both messages:

```plaintext
Ganondorf is alive!
Ganondorf is unalive!
```

When you only want code within an `if` block to run, use `return` to exit the function early.

## Assignment

Complete the `print_status` function.

- If `player_health` is `0`, _print_ the text `dead` to the console.
- Afterwards, whether or not the player is dead, _print_ the text `status check complete` to the console.

## Tip

Indentation matters! Indentation is what tells Python whether the body of a function or the if statement has ended. Also, don't forget the colon after your if statement `:` it is a required part of the syntax!
