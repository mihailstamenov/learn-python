# Comparison Operators
When coding it's necessary to be able to compare two values. `Boolean logic` is the name for these kinds of comparison operations that always result in `True` or `False`.

The operators:
- `<` "less than"
- `>` "greater than"
- `<=` "less than or equal to"
- `>=` "greater than or equal to"
- `==` "equal to"
- `!=` "not equal to"

For example:
```python
5 < 6 # evaluates to True
5 > 6 # evaluates to False
5 >= 6 # evaluates to False
5 <= 6 # evaluates to True
5 == 6 # evaluates to False
5 != 6 # evaluates to True
```

## Assignment
Complete the `player_1_wins` function. It should return `True` if player 1 has a higher score, and `False` otherwise.
